If your chain is not yet [connected to Union](/protocol/chains/overview/), then you can permissionlessly add support. Union supports L1s, L2s, L3s, and Rollups. The steps to connect are simple:

<Steps>
1. Upload `ibc-core` and `light-client` contracts.
2. Configure the [Voyager](/architecture/voyager) relayer.
3. Open the connection.
4. Send assets and data.
</Steps>
