Connecting a new CosmWasm chain is easy and can be done in four simple steps documented here:

<Steps>
1. Upload `ibc-core` and `light-client` contracts.
2. Configure the [Voyager](/architecture/voyager) relayer.
3. Open the connection.
4. Send assets and data.
</Steps>

## Upload IBC Core and Light Clients

Deployment of the Union EVM stack is fully automated. You can add a chain definition, and Union will generate deployment scripts for you. 

<Steps>
1. Clone `unionlabs/union`:

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:unionlabs/union
   ```

2. Add your chains configuration to [`evm/evm.nix`](https://github.com/unionlabs/union/blob/a408b8344d6c90791825e837d2be350809213695/evm/evm.nix#L214C9-L219C10). For example:

   ```nix
   {
     network = "holesky";
     rpc-url = "https://1rpc.io/holesky";
     private-key = ''"$1"'';
     extra-args = ''--verify --verifier etherscan --etherscan-api-key "$2"'';
   }
   ```

3. Use the gernated reproducible deployment script.

   ```bash
   nix run github:unionlabs/union#eth-deploy-$NETWORK-full
   ```
   for example, if your network is `"holesky"` above, it will be:

   ```bash
   nix run github:unionlabs/union#eth-deploy-holesky-full $EVM_PRIVKEY $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
   ```

   Providing an Etherscan API key is optional, but highly recommened as it will verify the uploaded contracts for you.
